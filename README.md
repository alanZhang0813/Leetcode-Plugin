# What's this all about?
Sometimes, you get a little stressed thinking about doing Leetcode, and it can be a tedious task to remember. Not to mention it's not exactly something that brings me joy, and yet I'm told I should do it every day to preserve and improve my coding skills.

But I decided nah. I think I'll just make a little something about Leetcode instead of actually doing Leetcode.
